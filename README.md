My attempt at the rock paper scissors game.

To play the game, please open up your console using by (ctrl shift i) or right-clicking and pressing Inspect.

Added functionality to restart the game after finishing it
and ability to select number of rounds at beginning of game.

Need to add validation to Players Selection- this feature will happen when I figure out how to do it!
